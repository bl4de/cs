Computer Science - data structures, algorithms, programming languages exercises/playground

### Advent Of Code, LeetCode and Project Euler problems solutions

Solutions to problems from LeetCode, AdventOfCode and Project Euler, moztly in Python, but also in PHP and JavaScript.
Probably in other programming languages in the future as well (putting it now in case I will foget toi update this README when this actually will happen :) )

### Data Structures and Algorithms 

My implementations of data structures and algorithms in differnet programming languages.
Mostly come from Udemy courses or my own implementation of various HackerRank, LeetCode or Project Euler problems.

### Programming Languages Playground and Exercises

My coding playground for different programming languages as I learn :)

### Licence? What licence? :D

This repository is open for all. 
Feel free to use code from it in any way you want/need (of course IF you want/need to use it in the first place ;) )
